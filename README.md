pacman project for MITxpro coding bootcamp :)

Moving PacMan from left to right

Description: This project shows some of the early skills I have learned during the MITxpro bootcamp, including using JavaScript to move images on a page in relation to page boundries. PacMan will move across the page, back and forth, chewing across the way!

Installation: Run from the browser! (Leave images in the folder where they are stored).

Usage: Open index.html in your browser

Support: Email me! castaldo.matthew@gmail.com

Roadmap: No roadmap to continue this project, as of yet!

License information: Code provided by MIT | Xpro, with a bit of my own work / additions! :)
